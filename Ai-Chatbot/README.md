If you’re explaining your AI Chatbot with Ollama project in an interview, you need to make it sound clear, purposeful, and technically impressive — even if it’s simple under the hood.

Here’s a structure you can follow:

1️⃣ Project Introduction (Elevator Pitch)

"This is an AI-powered chatbot built using Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend. It integrates with Ollama’s local LLaMA model to process user queries and return AI-generated responses in real-time."

2️⃣ Problem Statement

"The goal was to create a lightweight chatbot that doesn’t depend on cloud AI APIs like OpenAI’s, but instead runs fully on a local machine or server using Ollama. This helps in reducing API costs, increasing privacy, and allowing offline operation."

3️⃣ Tech Stack

Backend: Python + Flask (REST API to handle chat requests)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (simple UI for chatting)

AI Model: Ollama (LLaMA 3.2 — smaller model for low memory usage)

Hosting: AWS EC2 instance

Version Control: Git + GitHub

4️⃣ How It Works

Frontend UI

User types a message in the HTML input box.

JavaScript sends the message to Flask backend via /chat endpoint.

Backend Processing

Flask receives the message.

Sends it to Ollama’s API (http://localhost:11434/api/chat) with the selected model (e.g., llama3.2:1b).

Ollama processes the prompt and generates a response.

Response Delivery

Flask sends the AI response back to the frontend.

JavaScript updates the chat window with the reply.

5️⃣ Features

Works fully offline (no dependency on OpenAI API keys)

Minimal server cost since it runs on EC2 with a lightweight model

Real-time streaming responses

Easy to customize model and UI

6️⃣ Challenges You Faced

Managing memory constraints on EC2 (had to use a smaller model like llama3.2:1b)

Setting up Ollama and ensuring Flask could communicate with it

Configuring CORS for frontend-backend communication

7️⃣ Future Improvements

Add user authentication so each user gets a private chat

Store chat history in a database

Integrate speech-to-text for voice chatting

Add option to switch between multiple AI models
